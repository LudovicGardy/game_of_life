# Interactive Analysis of the French Real Estate Park Over Time

## üìÑ Description

üè° This project implements an interactive version of the classic simulation game, *John Conway's Game of Life*, using Pygame. The game allows users to select different starting patterns from classic configurations (like the *glider*, *small exploder*, and others) stored in a JSON file. A user-friendly interface lets users preview and choose their preferred configuration before launching the simulation.

ü§î The game's objective is to simulate the evolution of cells on a grid based on simple rules, which lead to complex and intriguing patterns. This project goes beyond simple simulation by offering a graphical interface where each user can select their starting pattern. This customization allows a better understanding of specific behaviors in each configuration, making the experience both educational and enjoyable.

This project is ideal for beginners in graphical programming with Python and for those interested in cellular automaton simulations. In addition to serving as a learning tool, the code is designed to be easily extensible, allowing the addition of new patterns or features, such as speed control and tracking initial configuration history.

### Game Rules
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automation method created by John Conway. Originally inspired by biological concepts, this game has been applied in various fields such as graphics, terrain generation, and more.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state and requires no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for "advanced players," by creating patterns with specific properties.

Since the Game of Life is structured on a grid of nine cells, each cell has eight neighboring cells, as shown in the provided figure. A given cell (i, j) in the simulation can be accessed on a grid [i][j], where i and j are the row and column indices, respectively. The value of a given cell at any moment depends on the state of its neighbors in the previous time step. Conway's Game of Life has four rules:

- If a cell is ON and has fewer than two ON neighbors, it turns OFF.
- If a cell is ON and has two or three neighbors that are ON, it remains ON.
- If a cell is ON and has more than three neighbors that are ON, it turns OFF.
- If a cell is OFF and has exactly three neighboring cells that are ON, it becomes ON.

## Prerequisites
- Anaconda or Miniconda
- Docker (for Docker deployment)

## ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Python libraries
    ```sh
    poetry install --no-root
    ```

## üìù Usage

### Running without Docker

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to directory**
    ```bash
    git pull https://github.com/LudovicGardy/game_of_life
    cd game_of_life
    ```

2. **Environment setup**
    - Create and/or activate the virtual environment:
        ```bash
        conda create -n myenv python=3.11
        conda activate myenv
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Launch the Streamlit App**
    - Run the Pygame application:
        ```bash
        python run main.py
        ```
    - Or the simplified version:
        ```bash
        cd simple_version
        python run main.py
        ```

### Running with Docker

1. **Prepare Docker environment**
    - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.

2. **Navigate to project directory**
    - For multiple containers:
        ```bash
        cd [path-to-app-folder-containing-docker-compose.yml]
        ```
    - For a single container:
        ```bash
        cd [path-to-app-folder-containing-Dockerfile]
        ```

3. **Build and start the containers**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    - The application will be accessible at `localhost:8501`.

    - ‚ö†Ô∏è If you encounter issues with `pymssql`, adjust its version in `requirements.txt` or remove it before building the Docker image.
